RGB Co-op Puzzle is a game made in Unity, as a project for the Network Games Programming university course.

The goal of this project was to implement a Multiplayer game in Unity, using .NET Framework.
I decided to develop a Co-op Puzzle game based on color states.

Game Goals:
- Complete each level by co-oping with the other player.

Game Mechanics:
- Grab the other Player;
- Damage pads based on the Players' colors;
- Jump pads;
- Color switcher pads, in order to pass through obstacles;
- Checkpoint pads.
